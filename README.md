# JustJava
#My First Android App 

# Made with JAVA and XML'
I learn by doing: consistently following the Android Basics tutorial on UDACITY
I built this appliation which shows a simple form in which the user can order for coffee add topings e.g Add some cream. by checkin or unchecking a checkBox. I the process of building this app I learnt about activities, intents(Explicit intent and Implicit intent), Widgets, wiring up the layout widgets to make them responsive and so on.
